## Impetus

We often keep data in several different `data.frame` objects (or tables in SQL databases).  Joins are a quick way to work with data from many different tables.

## Student Learning Objectives

At the end of this topic, you should be able to:  
 - Explain the difference between a *primary* and *foreign* key.
 - Describe the differences in join types including full, left, right, inner, outer, semi and anti joins.
 - Understand that joins also work for spatial contexts.

## Content
 - The [slides](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Joins/slides.html) used to describe the topic.
 - A more verbose [narrative](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Joins/narrative.html) on the general notion of joins with examples.
 - An [in class](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Joins/in-class.html) example of walking through these kinds of data.
 - The data set used for this include some shapefiles (for the slides) from RVA as well as the `nycflights13` package of `data.frames` for NYC airport data.  This is used in both the slides and the in-class examples.
